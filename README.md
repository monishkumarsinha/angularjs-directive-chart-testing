## Foundation

In **Directive Chart Testing** Iâ€™m going to do

* Update **Karma** package and Karma config file to version 0.10
* Update **.jshintrc** to use settings that I like
* Add **Jasmine-Jquery** adapter and write a few test
* Add new directive for chart generating

## Setup

* Follow the instructions in the blog post above to ensure your system is setup correctly.
* Clone the repository and cd into the project.
* `npm install && bower install`


## Test
Run `grunt test` from project directory or configure your favorite IDE, eg. configuration for **WebStorm 7** on **OSX**

* Node interpreter `/opt/local/bin/node`
* Karma Node package `angularjs-directive-chart-testing/node_modules/karma`
* Configuration file `angularjs-directive-chart-testing/karma.conf.js`
